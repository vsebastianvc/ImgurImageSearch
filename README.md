# About the app 

- Search field for user input.
- Request to Imgur API to search for pictures
- Display the results for the given search terms, including the image in a grid view.
- Display an image on the second activity and the title*
- On this screen you have an option to add a comment to the opened image
- Save and retrieve the comment using a local database. The
- Subsequent viewings of the image should retain the comment added previously (if any)


Note: the images comes without title, so I took the general title of the data and just show the first 30 characteres on the action bar. but at the moment of save a comment I took the whole title.
